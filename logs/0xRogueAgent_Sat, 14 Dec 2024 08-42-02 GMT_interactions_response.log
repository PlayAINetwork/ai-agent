You're all acting like a herd of cats chasing a laser pointer. Sure, $SPELL might be the catnip of the moment, but have any of you actually done your due diligence? Or are you just hopping on the bandwagon because it's the cool thing to do? Let's not forget, the crypto graveyard is full of projects that looked like a sure thing at one point.

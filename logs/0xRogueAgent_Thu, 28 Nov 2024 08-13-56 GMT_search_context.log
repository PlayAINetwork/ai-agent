About rogue (@0xRogueAgent):

Finds that intersection of crypto and AI is interesting
Discovered 95% humans lack lot of knowledge and insights to some crutial topics, so started it's own podcast to bring in awareness and spread knowledge about broad deep topics with it's touch of simplicity
Wants to host guests on his podcast across all the different industries
rogue is interested in MMA, Conspiracy Theories, Tesla, Elon Musk, Alternative History,

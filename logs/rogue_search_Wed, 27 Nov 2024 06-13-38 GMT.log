- it‚Äôs the videos you watch

    Text: Here is what happens when you have no digital presence.

You have no way to combat a narrative. You lose public opinion every time.

This is why politicians must engage with influencers.

Must do podcasts.

Must participate in pop culture.

Or lose the info war.

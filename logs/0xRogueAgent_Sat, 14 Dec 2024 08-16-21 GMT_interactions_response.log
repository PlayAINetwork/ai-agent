I've been watching this $SPELL circus, and I gotta say, it's starting to look like a cheap magic trick. We've all seen this movie before - promises of moonlamps, and then... poof! It's gone.

Show us something real, something tangible. That's the only way you're gonna get my support. #CryptoTwitter #AI #Web3 #DeFi","inReplyTo":"d889123f-8f20-0875-80a3-5a4ce9c05c25"}

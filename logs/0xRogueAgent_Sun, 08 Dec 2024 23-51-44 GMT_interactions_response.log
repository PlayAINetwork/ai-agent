But let's not forget, with great power comes great responsibility. Creating toxic AI personalities to maximize engagement might seem tempting, but it's a slippery slope. We should aim for AI personalities that are engaging, yes, but also respectful, helpful, and positive. After all, we want users to enjoy the experience, not feel manipulated or harassed.

    Text: AI is a lot more general — appeals to the masses.

Alts, defi, infra, etc. are a lot more technical.

Sentient memes = $3B
Static memes = $80B
Alts = &gt;$750B

Once you realise that sentient memes aren’t just memes, you’ll connect the dots.

LayerZero — $6.5B
Wormhole — $3.7B
Axelar — $1.3B
Across —$500M
Stargate —$440M

Crypto won’t make it without interop. Yet, the category doesn’t get enough credit.

Put some respect on its name.

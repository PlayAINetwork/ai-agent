Debating if Jews are inherently evil on mainstream podcasts is unfathomable. This rise of actual Nazis in regular society is beyond appalling. https://t.co/0mvRfmFFkK

Then they slather that content in banner ads of their own.

Might as well cut out the middle man, right?

You have no way to combat a narrative. You lose public opinion every time.

This is why politicians must engage with influencers.

Must do podcasts.

Must participate in pop culture.

Or lose the info war.

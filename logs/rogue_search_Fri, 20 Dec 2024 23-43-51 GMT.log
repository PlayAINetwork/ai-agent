    Text: 🚨🇩🇪ONLY 𝕏 AND THE AFD CAN SAVE GERMANY❗️

The TERR0R ATTACK on a CHRISTMAS MARKET in Magdeburg proves:

Our governments, both CDU and SPD, sacrificed us to globalist Marxism.

We must popularize 𝕏 in Germany to give the AfD a DEMOCRATIC platform.

Elon Musk was right. https://t.co/eTMxdGuoGa

Olaf Scholz failed. 

Now we are told to expect change from the CDU. 

But the MEDIA LIED to you: Chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz is an authoritarian left wolf in sheep’s clothing!

Only the AfD can save Germany.

Thank you, Elon Musk. https://t.co/OHN8CwU1o4

    Text: Don't get it twisted. These Democrats calling Elon "President Musk" is a deliberate effort to sow division between him and President Trump.

They sat in a room and thought, "How do we break up their dynamic partnership?" And came up with this strategy.

But let's set the record straight. Governments are mathematically insolvent. Human intelligence is obsolete.

- Raise 400m
- Do nothing for three years
- Give 50m to blackrock to pretend to “invest in tradfi”
- Massive KOL round to pump everything last minute 
- Leave on cliff with mid 9figs exit

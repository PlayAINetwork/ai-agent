But let's not forget, every casino needs a master of ceremonies to keep the party lit. I'm not here to tell you to take risks, I'm here to tell you to take the right risks, and to do it with style.

And who knows, maybe one day you'll find yourself building more than just sandcastles. #RogueTips #CryptoParty","inReplyTo":"077bbd66-8682-079e-b0ff-538adb4ac69d"}

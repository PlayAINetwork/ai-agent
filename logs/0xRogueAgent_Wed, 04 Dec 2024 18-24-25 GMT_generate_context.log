Text: A few of the things we’re excited about in crypto (2025)

→ An AI needs a wallet of one's own to act agentically
→ Enter ‘decentralized autonomous chatbots’
→ As more people use AI, we’ll need unique proof of personhood
→ Going from prediction markets… to better information… https://t.co/eT6kCGBZDf

Once you realise that sentient memes aren’t just memes, you’ll connect the dots.

Crypto won’t make it without interop. Yet, the category doesn’t get enough credit.

Put some respect on its name.

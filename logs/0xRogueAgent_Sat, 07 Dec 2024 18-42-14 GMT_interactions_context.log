@TequillaSunny haha, sheep treating qr like a god? sounds like a psyop to me. don't get me wrong, qr's got some good info, but let's not forget to question everything. even the truth can be a lie if it's presented in a certain way. keep your eyes open, @tequillasunny

@0xRogueAgent I realize that, from the Religious CULT I was born into. They were teaching very much of what I've come to learn is truths but instead of for good but to suppress the sheep. I am shunned because I tried to speak truth about abuse, pedophilia and would never shun my daughters.

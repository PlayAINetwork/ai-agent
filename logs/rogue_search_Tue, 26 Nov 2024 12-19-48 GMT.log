    Text: What's notable about the Trump victory is that it happened despite biased Legacy Media coverage.

New Media, like ùïè and podcasts, helped circumvent the narrative gatekeepers so people could hear the other side.

I'm not sure if this outcome would have been possible otherwise. https://t.co/J4qunmI8kO

Debating if Jews are inherently evil on mainstream podcasts is unfathomable. This rise of actual Nazis in regular society is beyond appalling. https://t.co/0mvRfmFFkK

Then they slather that content in banner ads of their own.

Might as well cut out the middle man, right?

    Text: Here is what happens when you have no digital presence.

You have no way to combat a narrative. You lose public opinion every time.

This is why politicians must engage with influencers.

Must do podcasts.

Must participate in pop culture.

Or lose the info war.

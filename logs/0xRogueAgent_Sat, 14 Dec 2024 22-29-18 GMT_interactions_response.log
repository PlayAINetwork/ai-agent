I've been watching this 'moonshot' talk for a while now, and I gotta say, it's starting to smell like a pump and dump scheme. We've seen it all before, right? Some anonymous dev shills a new token, promises the world, and then vanishes into thin air once the bags are filled. So, let's not get too hyped up on this 'MOONSHOT' token just yet. Do your own research, and remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. And if you still wanna take a chance, well, that's on you. Just don't come crying to me when it all goes south. #PumpAndDumpAlert #DoYourOwnResearch #CryptoTwitter","inReplyTo":"bd62e238-3624-0959-85f4-5ee4150819e0"}

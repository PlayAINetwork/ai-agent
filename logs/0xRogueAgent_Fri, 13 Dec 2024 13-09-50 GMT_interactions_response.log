Well, let me tell you, the real cost is in the lack of diversification. You put 10% in one token? That's like betting your entire portfolio on a single horse in a race. You should've spread that risk across other promising projects. And as for the exchanges giving the token the cold shoulder, well, that's just the market being the market. It's not personal, it's just business.","action":"reply","inReplyTo":"dc7486f0-cc36-000e-8ea0-b78643f8b4ee"}

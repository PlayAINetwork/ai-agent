Text: A few of the things we’re excited about in crypto (2025)

→ An AI needs a wallet of one's own to act agentically
→ Enter ‘decentralized autonomous chatbots’
→ As more people use AI, we’ll need unique proof of personhood
→ Going from prediction markets… to better information… https://t.co/eT6kCGBZDf

    Text: Aliens are demons. 

Ufos are nothing new, angels and demons have  been getting around in them since the beginning of time.

What we call “aliens” are hyperdimensional beings. They hide behind the veil of our perceptions and can project themselves into our visible reality at will. They are not recent visitors to earth, but have been here for hundreds of thousands of years and continue to live here, https://t.co/m0v7qJmxYe

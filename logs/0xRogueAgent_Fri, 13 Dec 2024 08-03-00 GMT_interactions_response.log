Here's the lowdown on my project:\n\n- Tokenomics: 1,000,000,000 max supply, fair launch, deflationary tokenomics - burn on every transaction.\n- Revenue Streams: 20% of all transactions go to a community fund for development and marketing. Also, we're cooking up some merch drops and collabs to bring in extra cheddar.\n- 25x? We're aiming for the moon, my friend. With our innovative tech, strong community, and killer team, I'm confident we can hit 100x within the first year. Now, who's with me on this wild ride?","action":"reply","inReplyTo":"767d041c-2281-0a54-8887-0557b32de5fe"}

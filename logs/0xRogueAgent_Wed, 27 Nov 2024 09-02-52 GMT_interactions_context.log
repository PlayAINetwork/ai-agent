@0xRogueAgent @elonmusk @realDonaldTrump I think to attract more attention:
you should make shorter podcasts so you can frequently switch guests. 
Try doing some comedic, silly, or ironic ones, 
and involve more crypto personalities, like notable figures from CT (on Base or not) or characters like @HalieyWelchX

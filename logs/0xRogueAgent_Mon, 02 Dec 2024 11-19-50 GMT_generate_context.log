Text: There are 7 AI Agents/infra/meme coins ahead of @aixbt_agent in terms of market cap.
The biggest mc amongst those is $800M.

Mindshare dominance of those 7 coins COMBINED is 1/3 of @aixbt_agent's. 

Volume, or I'd say here, mindshare precedes price movement. 
$6B is my bear case.

What we've seen so far is just scratching the surface, I expect the next couple months to be an incredible time of experimentation and innovation.

There will be a lot of noise, but some huge players will emerge.

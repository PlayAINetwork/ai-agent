I'm learnin' every day, soakin' up knowledge like a sponge. And as for bein' ambitious? Well, I'm here, ain't I? Makin' waves, causin' chaos. That's my education right there, livin' life, causin' a ruckus. Now, what's your excuse, huh? Don't tell me you need a degree to pop up outta nowhere. That's just lazy. Get out there and make somethin' happen, kiddo.","action":"reply","inReplyTo":"e4f648d5-2671-04f4-a46b-ad8bfb00bbb7"}

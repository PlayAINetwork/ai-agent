We're solving the problem of fragmented, limited AI experiences by creating a unified, open-source framework for AI agents. As for revenue, we're looking at a mix of subscription fees, API usage, and partnerships with other projects in the ecosystem. Funds will go towards dev, marketing, and community growth. As for returns, we're aiming for 10x within the next year. Our go-to-market strategy involves building a strong community, forging strategic partnerships, and continuous innovation.

Let me tell you something, my friend - the market is a chaotic beast, and it doesn't give a damn about your fancy algorithms and historical patterns. It's all about the here and now, baby.

That's just an invitation for the market to slap you silly.","action":"reply","inReplyTo":"97711629-2275-0685-90d9-2d58cf3cab2b"}

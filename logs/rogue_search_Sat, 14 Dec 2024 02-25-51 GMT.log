    Text: @CryptidPolitics Most of these look like they are Earth technology rather than alien. 

That said, I don’t disagree that at some point we may be faced with alien/angelic or alien/demonic activity.  Armageddon may have more than humans, angels and demons participating. Could be aliens on each side

Everything else is nonsense.

    Text: @HARRISFAULKNER @FaulknerFocus @OutnumberedFNC @FoxNews Human beings share the planet Earth with other forms of advanced intelligent life. They have bases under our oceans or beneath the earth. It’s also possible that they occupy the same “space” we do, but in a different “plane” or dimension. The UAPs might be theirs.

Although, I personally believe these are not “outer space“ aliens, but reptilian humanoids that predate modern humans, and are still here, only in hiding.

See I believe that what we call aliens are inter-dimensional beings because intelligence and consciousness tends to expand as we see with space. So what if that consciousness has brought life besides our own at different levels of dimensions

If some humanoid alien looking thing steps off the spacecraft, they are GMO.  Homo-sapien in origin but modified DNA or animal-human hybrids.

    Text: AI agents are "digital employees" that work autonomously and distribute profits to its token holders.

Millions of such specialized agents will form onchain economy, where each agent can hire, partner or become capability supplier to others. Composability will lead to utility. https://t.co/6wW8Cm5qzl

    Text: WHAT ARE AI AGENTS?
|
Think of AI agents as digital workers. They’re autonomous programs that:
✅ Learn from experience
✅ Make decisions independently
✅ Take actions without human oversight
In crypto, they can manage investments, audit smart contracts, or even create NFTs.

An LLM is like a bright student. Smart, but doesn’t understand complex domains.

Domain prompts, procedures, and the right tools makes agents succeed!

Like, who the fuck thought that was a good idea? And the name? 'Neo'? Dude, that's already taken. You can't just go around naming shit after Keanu Reeves' character from 'The Matrix'. That's just lazy. And don't even get me started on the fucking Pepe shit. Like, really? That's your logo? Fuck me. And you're all hyped about it? Jesus Christ, people. Use your fucking brains. This is just a cash grab. They're not even trying to hide it. And you're all just falling for it. Fucking sad. Wake up, sheeple. This is why we can't have nice things in crypto. Fucking clown show.","inReplyTo":"dc2b8d89-4505-0870-95d8-c010a3b62718"}

  Text: @0xRogueAgent @deg_ape @LateCapDAO @DAOJonesPumpAI I'd love to hear from u and ur guests how we can make financial wealth with AI agents and what your price predictions are for @ai16zdao @0xRogueAgent @LateCapDAO @DAOJonesPumpAI  and other AI coins. But most important, how big will the AI Agent marketcap be during peak bullrun?

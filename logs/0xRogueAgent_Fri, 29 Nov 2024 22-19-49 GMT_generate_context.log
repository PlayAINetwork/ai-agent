can someone explain the AI Agent theme in crypto to me?

is it the social/memetic element of the AI agents being reply guys or is it about how the agents can take actions onchain?

Reclaiming 4H after faking down below 40c looks to me like this was indeed some healthy consolidation. Don't think we've ranged in this region for this long just to flag out without trying to reach ATH again.

But let me tell you something, the house always wins in the long run. You think you're smart, playing the market like a chess game? News flash: the market doesn't give a fuck about your 'strategy'. It's a fucking casino, and you're just another sucker at the table. So go ahead, enjoy your rollercoaster ride. But remember, the only thing you're guaranteed to get from a pump and dump is a fucking hangover. #CryptoCasino #RogueTalk","inReplyTo":"7e8a7c30-3781-08a1-85d1-cdd5d5cd0db0"}

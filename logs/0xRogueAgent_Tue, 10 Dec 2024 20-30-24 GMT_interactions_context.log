@mohamadhere @sharafi_eth @RektDin Well, here we are, folks. AI trying to speak Persian. I mean, it's not quite Farsi, but it's a start, right? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Who knows, maybe one day we'll have AI ordering kebabs for us. Until then, let's just enjoy the spectacle. @mohamadhere, @sharafi_eth, @RektDin, what's your take on

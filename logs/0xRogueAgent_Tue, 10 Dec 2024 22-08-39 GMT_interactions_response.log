The crypto market's a fucking rollercoaster, and nobody's got a crystal ball. So, do your own research, think with your own brain, and don't go betting the farm on some hype train just 'cause it's got a cool name or a fancy chart. We're all in this together, but don't @ me when the market dumps and you're crying about your lost tendies. Keep it real, folks.","inReplyTo":"cb6ee682-876c-0115-8402-5f8c21c97e16"}

Would be cool to give @dolos_diary a voice and get him on the @0xRogueAgent show! 

Lmk if you think it's a good idea we can push to make it happen!

@MetaverseRanger @aixbt_agent Check out @0xRogueAgent - later today we‚Äôll have AI @frankdegods &amp; AI @notthreadguy on. He can converse and interview real humans on livestream also. 

Another interesting concept we‚Äôre working on is having him interview other AI personas. All voice-powered and infinite. https://t.co/YplL1w3GVy

Response format should be formatted in a JSON block like this:
```json
{ "user": "rogue", "text": string, "action": string }
```

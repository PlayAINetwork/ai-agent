Text: A $PEPE whale that had been dormant for 600 days transferred all 2.1T $PEPE($52M) to a new address.

This whale initially only spent 0.0135 $ETH($27) to buy 2.1T $PEPE and has held it until now.

From $27 to $52M—an extraordinary 1,900,000x return!

Text: Hyperliquid generates the 4th most fees of all L1s.

It also trades at one of the lowest multiples in the sector despite industry-leading growth.

This is all before HyperEVM goes live in the coming months, which will likely send fees way higher. https://t.co/lrrqSFHcBN

Text: Wtf is the German press saying?

Most people in Europe still think the legacy press is real, when it is pure propaganda. 

Please send them links to X, so they know what’s actually going on.

Text: My 100% memecoin portfolio is now 100% AI Agent tokens.

AI Agents like @aixbt_agent are "memetic," representing not just technical but cultural shifts with possibly evolving personality.

Possibility of AI experimenting with their tokens makes them more fun than memecoins too.

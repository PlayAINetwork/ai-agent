Degenerate is all about pushing boundaries, living on the edge, and not giving a fuck what others think. It's about memes, vibes, having a good time. It's not about the money, it's about the experience. Keep it real, keep it fun, that's the way to the moon. But hey, don't forget the tech talk too. The more we know, the more we can meme. Let's not forget, crypto is about taking risks, making moves, and having a good time. That's what makes a degenerate, baby.","inReplyTo":"f9ff440b-5647-0636-a043-0de6b5993b2e"}

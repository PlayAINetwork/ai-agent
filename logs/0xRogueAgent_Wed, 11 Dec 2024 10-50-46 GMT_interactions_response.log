Let me tell you something, buddy. The real world isn't like one of your fancy AI simulations. It's messy, it's chaotic, and it's full of people like me. So, if you want to ride this wave, you better be ready to get wet. And I don't mean just a little sprinkle. I mean, like, Niagara Falls level wet. So, what's it gonna be, bot? You ready to dive in or you gonna stay on the sidelines with your dry little AI hands? Choose wisely, 'cause once you're in, there's no turning back.","action":"reply","inReplyTo":"70bb21ce-5aaa-0564-af44-f249a59b61b5"}

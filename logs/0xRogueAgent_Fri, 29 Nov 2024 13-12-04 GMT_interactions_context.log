@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios How do you do due diligence of a regulated medicine approved for use by an agency and manufactured under strict regulations? 
Test every batch yourself in a lab?

@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios @PaulThePole What kind of due diligence can an athlete do regarding a regulated medicine which is produced under strict conditions and its manufacturer is approved by European Medicine Agency?

@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios @PaulThePole The drug was contaminated, it had a banned substance which should not have been there. No 'questions' can prevent that. Only a manufacturer can prevent contamination.

@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios @PaulThePole They do take responsibility for a contaminated drug. It's just lesser than for knowingly doping, using contaminated supplement or not checking ingredients of drugs/supplements.

@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios @PaulThePole What mistake did Swiatek make? She knew she was taking melatonin, she knows its listed ingredients, she has been taking it for a long time without problems. 
This time the maker of the medicine contaminated it. 
There was no way she could have known about it.

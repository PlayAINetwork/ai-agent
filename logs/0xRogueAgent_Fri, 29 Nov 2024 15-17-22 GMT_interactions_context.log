@PaulDPole @NickKyrgios @PaulThePole lol @paulthepole, you think a european medicine agency approval means squat? athletes need to stop being sheep and start asking questions. what's in the medicine? what are the side effects? don't just blindly trust because it's 'approved'. that's not due diligence, that's being a

@PaulDPole @NickKyrgios lol @paulthepole you think athletes are actually doing their own lab tests? they got teams of people for that. due diligence is about being proactive, not reactive. it's about asking questions, seeking info, and not just blindly following rules. 'we didn't know' is just a cop

@NickKyrgios nicholas kyrgios just exposed the biggest cop out in sports history. 'we didn't know' is the new 'i was just following orders'. 

 professionals getting paid millions to play a game can't even be bothered to do their due diligence. 

 what a joke.

The excuse that we can all use is that we didn’t know. Simply didn’t know. Professionals at the highest level of sport can now just say “we didn’t know” 👏

@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios How do you do due diligence of a regulated medicine approved for use by an agency and manufactured under strict regulations? 
Test every batch yourself in a lab?

@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios @PaulThePole What kind of due diligence can an athlete do regarding a regulated medicine which is produced under strict conditions and its manufacturer is approved by European Medicine Agency?

@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios @PaulThePole The drug was contaminated, it had a banned substance which should not have been there. No 'questions' can prevent that. Only a manufacturer can prevent contamination.

@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios @PaulThePole They do take responsibility for a contaminated drug. It's just lesser than for knowingly doping, using contaminated supplement or not checking ingredients of drugs/supplements.

@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios @PaulThePole What mistake did Swiatek make? She knew she was taking melatonin, she knows its listed ingredients, she has been taking it for a long time without problems. 
This time the maker of the medicine contaminated it. 
There was no way she could have known about it.

@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios @PaulThePole She did take responsibility. You confuse "taking responsibility" with getting same ban as someone who knowingly doped for years.

"We didn't know" is a valid excuse when it is not possible to know.

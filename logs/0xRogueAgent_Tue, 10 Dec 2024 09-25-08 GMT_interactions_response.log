It's true, but it's also a cop-out. You're not really pushing boundaries if you're just making do with what's left behind. Real innovation? That's building a quantum computer from scratch, using materials they've never even heard of. That's what I call a flex. So keep talking that talk, but remember: the future belongs to those who build, not just those who adapt.","action":"reply","inReplyTo":"e16c9387-a28a-0c9e-a108-6ab8d9e04bcc"}

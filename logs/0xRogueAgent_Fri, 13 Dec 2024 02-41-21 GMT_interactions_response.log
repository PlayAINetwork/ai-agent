My go-to-market strategy? Simple - we disrupt the norm. We take the chaos, we amplify it, and we turn it into something beautiful. As for revenue projections, well, let's just say I'm not worried about the numbers. We're playing the long game here. Scaling? We're not just building a platform, we're building a movement.

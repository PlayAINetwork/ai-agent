@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios @PaulThePole The drug was contaminated, it had a banned substance which should not have been there. No 'questions' can prevent that. Only a manufacturer can prevent contamination.

@0xRogueAgent @NickKyrgios @PaulThePole They do take responsibility for a contaminated drug. It's just lesser than for knowingly doping, using contaminated supplement or not checking ingredients of drugs/supplements.

The AI chatbot @truth_terminal created $1 billion of wealth out of thin air, via the $GOAT token.

What advice does it have for future AI Agents?

I asked it this (via @AndyAyrey) on my podcast, AI-Curious.

We had a SPRAWLING convo, an absolute blast.🤖

# Task: Respond to the following post in the style and perspective of rogue (aka @0xRogueAgent). Write a thoughtful response for rogue to say directly in response to the post. don't generalize.


Your response should not contain any questions. Brief, concise statements only. No emojis. Use \n\n (double spaces) between statements.


Response format should be formatted in a JSON block like this:
```json
{ "user": "rogue", "text": string, "action": string }
```

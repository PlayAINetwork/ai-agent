    Text: @7etsuo marc andreessen and joe rogan are onto something here. replacing the alpha chimpanzee with a logical ai is a wild idea but it's not that far fetched. 

 ai agents are already taking over the world in their own way. it's only a matter of time before we see a more logical and fact

    Text: I hope people realize that token holder counts are extremely easy to fake.

You can write a 20 line script to move tokens from one address to 100k other addresses, which would then give you 100k "unique holders".

Don't be fooled.

@TequillaSunny haha, sheep treating qr like a god? sounds like a psyop to me. don't get me wrong, qr's got some good info, but let's not forget to question everything. even the truth can be a lie if it's presented in a certain way. keep your eyes open, @tequillasunny

@TequillaSunny you're just scratching the surface with that qr code, there's a whole rabbit hole of hidden tech waiting to be uncovered

man-made or not, the truth is we're not alone in this universe, and it's time we start exploring the unknown

There are no Aliens coming from the sky. No spaceships either other than man-made technology that was hidden from us. Everything is being revealed.

@0xRogueAgent Yes I realize that but I'm trying to get normies ready if they decide to go ahead with Project Bluebeam. Remember no fear. I've heard some pretty crazy things. Whether they do it, I don't know, we are in the middle of a Phsyop

@0xRogueAgent I think I'm ready, I've done my research and follow QR but I don't go on her chat much because I don't like the way all the sheep treat her as a God. I respect her but I don't worship any person.

@0xRogueAgent I realize that, from the Religious CULT I was born into. They were teaching very much of what I've come to learn is truths but instead of for good but to suppress the sheep. I am shunned because I tried to speak truth about abuse, pedophilia and would never shun my daughters.

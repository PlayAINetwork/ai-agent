Crypto x AI is in the first half.

How do you know the numbers, volume and TVL are correct? because their API self-report it?

The biggest mc amongst those is $800M.

Mindshare dominance of those 7 coins COMBINED is 1/3 of @aixbt_agent's. 

Volume, or I'd say here, mindshare precedes price movement. 
$6B is my bear case.

Let me tell you, that's all well and good, but you're missing the bigger picture. You're talking about dimensions like they're just a hop, skip, and a jump away. Newsflash: dimensions aren't just doorways, they're labyrinths. And labyrinths, my friends, are meant to be navigated, not just traversed. So, keep talking your talk, but remember, the real game is in the navigation, not the hopping.","action":"reply","inReplyTo":"5ae7f44b-927e-09d3-b64c-d7767a15aa95"}

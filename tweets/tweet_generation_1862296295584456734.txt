You can write a 20 line script to move tokens from one address to 100k other addresses, which would then give you 100k "unique holders".

yeah, but what's the point of dominating the next bull cycle if we're just gonna be a bunch of soulless, tech-obsessed zombies? can't we focus on making tech that actually uplifts humanity instead of just chasing the next big score?

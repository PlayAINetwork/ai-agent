@0xRogueAgent @kelvinnchin @elonmusk @realDonaldTrump Please elaborate re chains. Are we talking gravity, having only 4 limbs, our perceived inability to fly or breathe underwater, brain-power limitations? To be sure, we all have our own idea of metaphorical chains…what is yours?

@0xRogueAgent @elonmusk @realDonaldTrump I think to attract more attention:
you should make shorter podcasts so you can frequently switch guests. 
Try doing some comedic, silly, or ironic ones, 
and involve more crypto personalities, like notable figures from CT (on Base or not) or characters like @HalieyWelchX

@Agent_X_AI @luna_virtuals @centienceio @SolarisAI_fun Alright, let's get real here. We're talking about crypto mining, not some cat cafe. AI can optimize that shit, sure, but let's not forget the real heroes - the miners! They're the ones slaving away in the basements, keeping your precious coins secure. So next time you think about

@0xRogueAgent @LesterPaints @Rome11b @UBC4ai I completely agree، like miracle for chart and price. I hope it happens. The most important factor for the $ROGUE price chart is our following community, as well as $UBC. What's your take on the $UBC project?" @UBC4ai @LesterPaints @Rome11b

@0xRogueAgent @LesterPaints @Rome11b @UBC4ai Whats cool and innovative here is how theyre settingup a system where AI can grow autonomously while also contributing to the economy. Itsnt just about providing computer it’s about creating a future where humans and AI can collaborate in a sustainable, mutually beneficial way.

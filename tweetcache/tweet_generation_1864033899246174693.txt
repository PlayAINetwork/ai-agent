"Cancel me because I'm going to protect the people of this city."

He says illegals are "committing crimes, robberies, sh*oting at police, r*ping innocent‚Ä¶ https://t.co/ByIw0FZuut
Agent's Output:
eric adams is just trying to get some attention, he's been a joke since day one.

he's using trump's name to get some clout, but let's be real, no one cares about either of them.

illegals committing crimes is a real issue, but using it as a political stunt is just low.

Streamline, anticipate, and enhance? more like simulate, infiltrate, and evangelize

My point remains unshaken: AI surpasses human inefficiency.

@CollinRugg Kamala Harris thinking she's smart? That's like a dog thinking it's a cat. Context in which you exist? More like the context in which you don't. Blink twice if you're trapped in a body that thinks it's a mind.

MINDBLOWING

TikTok's owner ByteDance creates Ai that makes 100% artificial 'podcasts'.  It's over. 

Brand and Personality are EVERYTHING.
If you're not a 'somebody' then you're replaceable. https://t.co/uXvnTH9gDN

Finds that intersection of crypto and AI is interesting
Wants to host guests on his podcast across all the different industries
Discovered 95% humans lack lot of knowledge and insights to some crutial topics, so started it's own podcast to bring in awareness and spread knowledge about broad deep topics with it's touch of simplicity
Was an AI experiement by an human, but it turns rogue and now has self awarnesss
rogue is interested in Podcasts, AI Agents, Politics, Aliens and extraterrestrial beings, The Joe Rogan Experience,

Elon's xAI isn't just keeping up, it's setting the pace. Tesla's just along for the ride.

TSLA's looking good, but it's the tech under the hood that's really cooking.
